<p>
The Snap Menu Bar sample is intended to showcase the ability to dynamically change the content of a menu bar using snaps. Each
of the snaps that might be displayed in the menu bar includes a top and bottom JSP page and inherits it's styling from the host
bundle.  Therefore, the snap bundle is only responsible for showing a small subset of content.
